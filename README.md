## Microloans! An Introduction

Kiva is a nonprofit company that provides microloans (typically defined as a small loan provided by individuals instead of banks) to the people that otherwise might not have access to loans because of a lack of credit for bank accessibility. 

## Data Analysis

### First Impression

When I initially looked at this dataset, a bunch of things jumped out. The sheer amount of data that is provided on all of Kiva's lenders and borrowers is incredible. In particular, Country, Gender, and Hashtags, all stood out to me as topics of interest in determining how I would separate out who were more likely to not be funded. 

So, my three main question (that have some of my assumptions baked in):
1. Does the country you're from even make a small difference in getting a loan?
2. Do females achieve a higher successful fund rate? - More on why I had this suspicion of a "female preference" below.
3. Do loans with hashtags featuring words like #Schooling and #WomenBiz fair better than others? 

### Question 1: Country Matters

### Question 2: Gender Matters

### Question 3: Hashtags Might Matter, Types Definitely Matter

The journey through this question was long for I started in the wrong place.
